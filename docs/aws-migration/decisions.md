# Architecture decision log

## D001: Nuxt 4 static generation

Status: accepted

Use Nuxt 4 with static generation. Dynamic schedule content is fetched in the
browser. This preserves SEO for editorial pages without requiring an
always-running server.

## D002: CloudFront and private S3

Status: accepted

Use regular private S3 bucket origins with CloudFront Origin Access Control.
Do not use public S3 website endpoints.

## D003: Monthly JSON instead of a database

Status: accepted

Store one availability document per stadium per calendar month. Current access
patterns require only key-based read and whole-month update. DynamoDB would add
data modeling, permissions and operational surface without a current query or
concurrency requirement that justifies it.

Revisit if:

- Multiple independent editors frequently update the same stadium/month.
- Partial updates or searchable history become product requirements.
- A monthly object approaches the 32 KiB contract limit.

## D004: Separate web and mutable-data buckets

Status: accepted

The schedule-update Lambda must not have a path to modify executable website
content.

## D005: Cognito User Pool with Google federation

Status: accepted

Preserve Google sign-in through standard OIDC. Use API Gateway JWT validation
and a Lambda `admins` group check. Do not use Cognito Identity Pools or expose
AWS credentials to the browser.

## D006: Minimal dependencies

Status: accepted

Use plain CSS and semantic HTML. Do not migrate Vuetify, Bootstrap, Stylus,
Moment, Vuex, Firebase, AdSense wrappers or the service-worker package.

Every new dependency beyond the allowlist in `architecture.md` needs a new
decision entry before installation.

## D007: No date dependency

Status: accepted

Use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to derive the Japan calendar date and pure,
well-tested date-only helpers for arithmetic. Do not use viewer-local
`Date` arithmetic.

## D008: No PWA in the first release

Status: accepted

Availability freshness matters more than offline behavior. Reintroducing a
service worker requires a separate cache/freshness design.

## D009: Same-origin administrator API

Status: accepted

Route `/api/*` through CloudFront to API Gateway. This avoids production CORS
complexity and keeps one browser origin. Public reads remain `/data/*`.

## D010: Single AWS preview-to-production stack

Status: accepted

To reduce cost, create one AWS stack and validate it through the CloudFront
distribution domain. Attach production DNS after final approval instead of
maintaining duplicate long-lived staging infrastructure.

## D011: Scoped standard CDK bootstrap

Status: accepted

Problem:

The target account is not bootstrapped. The standard bootstrap defaults the
CloudFormation execution role to `AdministratorAccess`, which is broader than
the preview hosting stack needs.

Decision:

Use the standard modern CDK bootstrap in account `470447451992`, region
`ap-northeast-1`, with no cross-account trust and with a project-specific
managed CloudFormation execution policy. The policy permits only the named
preview S3 buckets, the CloudFront operations required by the hosting stack,
bootstrap-version SSM reads, and conditional creation of the CloudFront
service-linked role. Unsupported resource-level CloudFront operations may use
`Resource: "*"` but never `Action: "*"`.

Alternatives:

- Default `AdministratorAccess`: rejected as unnecessarily broad.
- `PowerUserAccess`: rejected because it grants unrelated services.
- A bootstrapless synthesizer using the current IAM user directly: rejected
  because it removes the distinct deployment role and creates a nonstandard
  long-term operational path.

Cost and maintenance effect:

Standard bootstrap adds an empty staging bucket and ECR repository plus CDK
roles. Empty resources have negligible ongoing cost; the managed execution
policy must be reviewed when the stack gains a new AWS service.

Rollback/removal:

Before production use, the `ItsRunPreviewHosting` and `CDKToolkit` stacks and
the project execution policy can be removed after confirming no other CDK
application uses the default qualifier in this account/region.
